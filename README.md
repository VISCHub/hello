**MetaMask** is a set of tools for Ethereum integration in your browser, enabling users to:
- Display wallet balances and send ether through LightWallet
- Visit Ethereum enabled websites using the web3 API
- Confirm or reject balance transactions that are requested by dapps
- Interact with the Ethereum blockchain without setting up a full node

MetaMask is currently under active development. Release of the source code will be available soonâ„¢.

If you have any questions relating to development, bugs, or general inquiries, file them [here](https://github.com/MetaMask/talk/issues/new) in our issues tracker. We are also generally responsive to inquiries on our Slack channel, which can be found [here](http://slack.metamask.io/).
